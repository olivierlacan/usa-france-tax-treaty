## LETTER OF SUBMITTAL

## DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

Washington, September 9, 1994.
The PRESIDENT,
The White House.

THE PRESIDENT: I have the honor to submit to you, with a view to its transmission to the
Senate for advice and consent to ratification, the Convention Between the Government of the
United States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the Avoidance of
Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and
Capital, signed at Paris on August 31, 1994, together with two related exchanges of notes signed
on the same date.

The new Convention will replace the existing income tax convention between the United
States and France, which was signed in 1967 and amended by Protocols signed in 1970, 1978,
1984, and 1988, and the side letters relating thereto. The new Convention maintains many
provisions of the existing convention; but it also provides certain additional benefits, and it
updates the text to reflect current tax treaty policies.

Like all U.S. income tax conventions, this Convention provides rules specifying when
income that arises in one of the countries and is derived by residents of the other country may be
taxed by the country in which the income arises (the “source country”). Rules are provided for
each category of income, such as business profits, investment income, and personal service
income. The Convention confirms that the country of residence will avoid international double
taxation by providing relief for the tax imposed by the source country. It also provides for
administrative cooperation between the tax authorities of the two countries in applying the
Convention and the taxes covered by the Convention. The benefits of the Convention are limited
to qualified residents of the two countries.

The new Convention confirms that residents of each country include tax-exempt
organizations created for charitable and other not-for-profit purposes or for purposes of providing
pension benefits, and extends to them part of the dividend tax credit that France provides in the


Convention to other U.S. portfolio investors. It also addresses the treatment of dividends paid by
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts, bringing those provisions into
line with current U.S. treaty policy. The new Convention clarifies the scope of the exemption at
source of copyright royalties.

An important improvement in the new Convention is the modernization of the limitation on
benefits provisions, designed to ensure that the benefits of the Convention are enjoyed only by
those persons intended to derive such benefits. The compliance aspects of the Convention are
also strengthened by bringing up to date the provisions concerning associated enterprises and the
exchange of tax information.

The new Convention preserves the special French tax benefits for U.S. citizens residing in
France and for French residents who are partners of U.S. partnerships.

The exchanges of diplomatic notes accompany the Convention and state the understandings
of the two delegations with respect to the application of the Convention in specified cases.

The United States and France will notify each other when their respective constitutional and
statutory requirements for the entry into force of the Convention have been satisfied. The
Convention will enter into force on the date of receipt of the later of those notifications. The
provisions concerning taxes on dividends, interests, and royalties and the U.S. excise tax on
insurance premiums paid to foreign insurers will take effect on the first day of the second month
following the entry into force. The provisions concerning other taxes generally will take effect
for taxable years or taxable events occurring on or after January 1 of the year following the entry
into force. However, certain provisions concerning the availability of the French dividend tax
credit and the application of the copyright royalty exemption will apply for dividends and
royalties paid or credited on or after January 1, 1991. The 1967 convention and the related
exchanges of letters will cease to have effect as of the date on which the provisions of this
Convention become effective.

A technical memorandum explaining in detail the provisions of the Convention will be
prepared by the Department of Treasury and will be submitted separately to the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations.

The Department of the Treasury and the Department of State cooperated in the negotiation of
the convention. It has the full approval of both Departments.

Respectfully submitted,

```
WARREN CHRISTOPHER.

## LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL

THE WHITE HOUSE, September 19, 1994.
To the Senate of the United States:

I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention Between the
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the
Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on
Income and Capital, signed at Paris on August 31, 1994, together with two related exchanges of
notes. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State
with respect to the Convention.

The Convention replaces the 1967 income tax convention between the United States of
America and the French Republic and the related protocols and exchanges of notes. The new
Convention more accurately reflects current income tax treaty policies of the two countries.

I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and
related exchanges of notes and give its advice and consent to ratification.

```
WILLIAM J. CLINTON.

referred to as "French tax").
2. The Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are
imposed after the date of signature of the Convention in addition to, or in place of, the existing
taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any
significant changes which have been made in their respective taxation laws and of any official
published material concerning the application of the Convention, including explanations,
regulations, rulings, or judicial decisions.

person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile,

       United States) a political subdivision thereof limit the use of the organization’s
       assets, both currently and upon the dissolution or liquidation of such organization,
       to the accomplishment of the purposes that serve as the basis for such

       tax therein shall be treated as a partnership for purposes of United States tax
       benefits under this Convention.
3. Where, by reason of the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, an individual is a resident of
both Contracting States, his status shall be determined as follows:
    (a) he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which he has a permanent
    home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both Contracting
    States, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State with which his personal and
    economic relations are closer (center of vital interests);
       (b) if the State in which he has his center of vital interests cannot be determined,
    or if he does not have a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be
    deemed to be a resident of the State in which he has an habitual abode;

authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement.
```
4. Where, by reason of the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, a person other than an individual
is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities shall endeavor to settle the
question by mutual agreement, having regard to the person’s place of effective management, the
place where it is incorporated or constituted, and any other relevant factors. In the absence of
such agreement, such person shall not be considered to be a resident of either Contracting State
for purposes of enjoying benefits under this Convention.

## ARTICLE 5

```

    (d) a factory;
    (e) a workshop; and

resources.
3. The term "permanent establishment" shall also include a building site or construction or
installation project, or an installation or drilling rig or ship used for the exploration or to prepare
for the extraction of natural resources, but only if such site or project lasts, or such rig or ship is
used, for more than twelve months.

establishment" shall be deemed not to include:
    (a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display, or delivery of
goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;

fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary
character.

of an independent status to whom paragraph 6 applies - is acting on behalf of an enterprise and
has and habitually exercises in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts in the name
of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State
in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of
such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed
place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under
the provisions of that paragraph.
6. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting
State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission
agent, or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the
ordinary course of their business as such.
7. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled
by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in
that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself
constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.

## ARTICLE 6

```
Income From Real Property
```
1. Income from real property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in a
Contracting State may be taxed in that State.
2. The term "real property" shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the

any other form of real property.

enterprise and to income from real property used for the performance of independent personal
services.
5. Where the ownership of shares or other rights in a company entitles a resident of a
Contracting State to the enjoyment of real property situated in the other Contracting State and
held by that company, the income derived by the owner from the direct use, letting, or use in any
other form of this right of enjoyment may be taxed in that other State to the extent that it would
be taxed under the domestic law of that other State if the owner were a resident of that State. The
provisions of this paragraph shall apply, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 (Business


Profits) and 14 (Independent Personal Services).

6. A resident of a Contracting State who is liable to tax in the other Contracting State on
income from real property situated in the other Contracting State may elect to be taxed on a net
basis, if such treatment is not provided under the domestic law of that other State.

## ARTICLE 7

```
Business Profits
```
1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless
the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent
establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the
enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that
permanent establishment.
2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries
on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein,
there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits
which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and independent enterprise engaged in
the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions.
3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as
deductions expenses which are reasonably connected with such profits, including executive and
general administrative expenses, whether incurred in the State in which the permanent
establishment is situated or elsewhere.
4. A partner shall be considered to have realized income or incurred deductions to the extent
of his share of the profits or losses of a partnership, as provided in the partnership agreement
(provided that any special allocations of profits or losses have substantial economic effect). For
this purpose, the character (including source and attribution to a permanent establishment) of any
item of income or deduction accruing to a partner shall be determined as if it were realized or
incurred by the partner in the same manner as realized or incurred by the partnership.
5. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase
by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.
6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs of this Article, the profits to be attributed to
the permanent establishment shall include only the profits or losses derived from the assets or
activities of the permanent establishment and shall be determined by the same method year by
year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.
7. Any profit attributable to a permanent establishment, according to the provisions of this
Article, during its existence may be taxed in the Contracting State in which such permanent
establishment is situated, even if the payments are deferred until such permanent establishment
has ceased to exist.
8. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of


this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of
this Article.

## ARTICLE 8

```
Shipping and Air Transport
```
1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in
international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.
2. For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in
international traffic include:
    (a) profits of the enterprise derived from the rental on a full basis of ships or
aircraft operated in international traffic, and profits of the enterprise derived from the
rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft if such ships or aircraft are operated in
international traffic by the lessee or such rental profits are accessory to other profits
described in paragraph 1; and
(b) profits of the enterprise from the use, maintenance or rental of containers used
in international traffic (including trailers, barges, and related equipment for the transport
of such containers) if such profits are accessory to other profits described in paragraph 1.
3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from participation in a
pool, a joint business, or an international operating agency.

## ARTICLE 9

```
Associated Enterprises
```
1. Where:
    (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the
management, control, or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State; or
(b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control,
or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other
Contracting State,
. and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their
    commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between
    independent enterprises, then any profits which, but for those conditions, would have
    accrued to one of the enterprises, but by reason of those conditions have not so accrued,
    may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly
2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State, and taxes
accordingly, profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax
in that other State, and the other Contracting State agrees that the profits so included are profits
that would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made
between the two enterprises had been those that would have been made between independent
enterprises, then that other State shall, in accordance with the provisions of Article 26 (Mutual
Agreement Procedure), make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein
on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be paid to the other provisions


of this Convention.

## ARTICLE 10

```
Dividends
```
1. Dividends paid by a company that is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the
other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.
2. Such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying
the dividends is a resident, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of
the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:
    (a) 5 percent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a
company that owns:
(i) directly, at least 10 percent of the voting power in the company paying
    the dividends, if such company is a resident of the United States; or
       (ii) directly or indirectly, at least 10 percent of the capital of the company
    paying the dividends, if such company is a resident of France;
    (b) 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends in other cases. The provisions
of subparagraph (a) shall not apply in the case of dividends paid by a United States
regulated investment company or real estate investment trust or by a French "société

regulated investment company or a French "société d'investissement capital variable," the
provisions of subparagraph (b) shall apply. In the case of dividends paid by a United
States real estate investment trust, the provisions of subparagraph (b) shall apply only if
the dividend is beneficially owned by an individual owning a less than 10 percent interest
in such real estate investment trust; otherwise, the rate of withholding tax applicable
under the domestic law of the United States shall apply.
3. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the
profits out of which the dividends are paid.
4. (a) A resident of the United States who derives and is the beneficial owner of
    dividends paid by a company that is a resident of France that, if received by a resident of
    France would entitle such a resident to a tax credit ("avoir fiscal") shall be entitled to a
    payment from the French Treasury equal to such tax credit ("avoir fiscal"), subject to
    deduction of the tax provided for in subparagraph (b) of paragraph 2.
       (b) The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall apply only to a resident of the United
    States that is:
       (i) an individual or other person (other than a company) ; or
       (ii) a company that is not a regulated investment company and that does
       not own, directly or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the capital of the company
       paying the dividends; or
          (iii) a regulated investment company that does not own, directly or
       indirectly, 10 percent or more of the capital of the company paying the dividends,
       but only if less than 20 percent of its shares is beneficially owned by persons who
       are neither citizens nor residents of the United States.
       (c) The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall apply only if the beneficial owner of


```
the dividends is subject to United States income tax in respect of such dividends and of
the payment from the French Treasury.
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (b) and (c), the provisions of
subparagraph (a) shall also apply to a partnership or trust described in subparagraph (b)
(iv) of paragraph 2 of Article 4 (Resident), but only to the extent that the partners,
beneficiaries, or grantors would qualify under subparagraph (b) (i) or (b) (ii) and under
subparagraph (c) of this paragraph.
(e) (i) A resident of the United States described in subparagraph (ii) that does
not own, directly or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the capital of a company that
is a resident of France, and that derives and beneficially owns dividends paid by
such company that, if derived by a resident of France, would entitle such resident
to a tax credit ("avoir fiscal”), shall be entitled to a payment from the French
Treasury equal to 30/85 of the amount of such tax credit (“avoir fiscal”), subject
to the deduction of the tax provided for in subparagraph (b) of paragraph 2;
(ii) The provisions of subparagraph (i) shall apply to:
(aa) a person described in subparagraph (b) (i) of paragraph 2 of
Article 4 (Resident), with respect to dividends derived by such person
from the investment of retirement assets;
(bb) a pension trust and any other organization described in
subparagraph (b) (ii) of paragraph 2 of Article 4 (Resident); and
(cc) an individual, with respect to dividends beneficially owned by
such individual and derived from investment in a retirement arrangement
under which the contributions or the accumulated earnings receive tax-
favored treatment under U.S. law.
(f) The gross amount of a payment made by the French Treasury pursuant to
subparagraph (a), (d), or (e) shall be deemed to be a dividend for the purposes of this
Convention.

code (code general des impôts) or with any similar provisions which amend or
replace the provisions of that Article.
(b) The taxes referred to in subparagraph (a) also shall apply to the portion of
    business profits, or of the income subject to tax under Article 6 (Real Property) or
    paragraph 1 of Article 13 (Capital Gains) that is referred to in subparagraph (a), which is
    attributable to a trade or business conducted in one Contracting State through a

attributable to such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article
7 (Business Profits) or Article 14 (Independent Personal Services), as the case may be, shall

with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne
by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the

between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the
debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount that would have been agreed upon by the
payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article

provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) or Article 14 (Independent Personal Services), as the
case may be, shall apply.
6. (a) Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a
    resident of that State.
       (b) Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a
    Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed
    base in Connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such
    royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties


```
shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base
is situated.
(c) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (a) and (b), royalties paid for the use of,; or the
right to use, property in a Contracting State shall be deemed to arise therein.

       (i) the French income tax paid by or on behalf of such citizen or resident;
and
(ii) in the case of a United States company owning at least 10 percent of
the voting power of a company that is a resident of France and from which the
United States company receives dividends, the French income tax paid by or on
behalf of the distributing corporation with respect to the profits out of which the
dividends are paid.
(b) In the case of an individual who is both a resident of France and a citizen of
    the United States:
       (i) the United States shall allow as a credit against the United States
income tax the French income tax paid after the credit referred to in subparagraph


```
(a) (iii) of paragraph 2. However, the credit so allowed against United States
income tax shall not reduce that portion of the United States income tax that is
creditable against French income tax in accordance with subparagraph (a) (iii) of
paragraph 2;
(ii) income referred to in paragraph 2 and income that, but for the
citizenship of the taxpayer, would be exempt from United States income tax under
the Convention, shall be considered income from sources within France to the
extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of subparagraph (b) (i). The
provisions of this subparagraph (b) (ii) shall apply only to the extent that an item
of income is included in gross income for purposes of determining French tax. No
provision of this subparagraph (b) relating to source of income shall apply in
determining credits against United States income tax for foreign taxes other than
French income tax as defined in subparagraph (e) ; and
(c) In the case of an individual who is both a resident and citizen of the United
States and a national of France, the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 29
(Miscellaneous Provisions) shall apply to remuneration and pensions described in
paragraph 1 or 2 of Article 19 (Public Remuneration) , but such remuneration and
pensions shall be treated by the United States as income from sources within France.
(d) If, for any taxable period, a partnership of which an individual member is a
resident of France so elects, for United States tax purposes, any income which solely by
reason of paragraph 4 of Article 14 is not exempt from French tax under this Article shall
be considered income from sources within France. The amount of such income shall
reduce (but not below zero) the amount of partnership earned income from sources
outside the United States that would otherwise be allocated to partners who are not
residents of France. For this purpose, the reduction shall apply first to income from
sources within France and then to other income from sources outside the United States. If
the individual member of the partnership is both a resident of France and a citizen of the
United States, this provision shall not result in a reduction of United States tax below that
which the taxpayer would have incurred without the benefit of deductions or exclusions
available solely by reason of his presence or residence outside the United States.
(e) For the purposes of this Article, the term "French income tax" means the taxes
referred to in subparagraph (b) (i) or (ii) of paragraph 1 of Article 2 (Taxes Covered), and
any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of
the Convention in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes.
```
2. In the case of France, double taxation shall be avoided in the following manner.
    (a) Income arising in the United States that may be taxed or shall be taxable only
in the United States in accordance with the provision of this Convention shall be taken
into account for the computation of the French tax where the beneficiary of such income
is a resident of France and where such income is not exempted from company tax
according to French domestic law. In that case, the United States tax shall not be
deductible from such income, but the beneficiary shall be entitled to a tax credit against
the French tax. Such credit shall be equal:
(i) in the case of income other than that referred to in subparagraphs (ii)
    and (iii), to the amount of French tax attributable to such income;
       (ii) in the case of income referred to in Article 14 (Independent Personal
    Services), to the amount of French tax attributable to such income; however, in
    the case referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 14 (Independent Personal Services),


such credit shall not give rise to an exemption that exceeds the limit specified in
that paragraph;
(iii) in the case of income referred to in Article 10 (Dividends), Article 11
(Interest), Article 12 (Royalties), paragraph 1 of Article 13 (Capital Gains),
Article 16 (Directors’ Fees), and Article 17 (Artistes and Sportsmen), to the
amount of tax paid in the United States in accordance with the provisions of the
Convention; however, such credit shall not exceed the amount of French tax
attributable to such income.
(b) In the case where the beneficial owner of the income arising in the United
States is an individual who is both a resident of France and a citizen of the United States,
the credit provided in paragraph 2 (a) (i) shall also be granted in the case of:
(i) income consisting of dividends paid by a company that is a resident of
the United States, interest arising in the United States, as described in paragraph 5
of Article 11 (Interest), or royalties arising in the United States, as described in
paragraph 6 of Article 12 (Royalties), that is derived and beneficially owned by
such individual and that is paid by:
(aa) the United States or any political subdivision or local authority
thereof; or
(bb) a person created or organized under the laws of a state of the
United States or the District of Columbia, the principal class of shares of
or interests in which is substantially and regularly traded on a recognized
stock exchange as defined in subparagraph (e) of paragraph 6 of Article 30
(Limitation on Benefits of the Convention) or
(cc) a company that is a resident of the United States, provided that
less than 10 percent of the outstanding shares of the voting power in such
company was owned (directly or indirectly) by the resident of France at all
times during the part of such company’s taxable period preceding the date
of payment of the income to the owner of the income and during the prior
taxable period (if any) of such company, and provided that less than 50
percent of such voting power was owned (either directly or indirectly) by
residents of France during the same period; or
(dd) a resident of the United States, not more than 25 percent of the
gross income of which for the prior taxable period (if any) consisted
directly or indirectly of income derived from sources outside the United
States;
(ii) capital gains derived from the alienation of capital assets generating
income described in subparagraph (i); however, such alienation shall be taken into
account for the determination of the threshold of taxation applicable in France to
capital gains on movable property;
(iii) profits or gains derived from transactions on a public United States
options or futures market;
(iv) income dealt with in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1 of Article 18
(Pensions) to the extent attributable to services performed by the beneficiary of
such income while his principal place of employment was in the United States;
(v) income that would be exempt from United States tax under Articles 20
(Teachers and Researchers) or 21 (Students and Trainees) if the individual were
not a citizen of the United States; and
(vi) U.S. source alimony and annuities. The provisions of this


subparagraph (b) shall apply only if the citizen of the United States who is a
resident of France demonstrates that he has complied with his United States
income tax obligations, and subject to receipt by the French tax administration of
such certification as may be prescribed by the competent authority of France, or
upon request to the French tax administration for refund of tax withheld together
with the presentation of any certification required by the competent authority of
France.
(c) A resident of France who owns capital that may be taxed in the United States
according to the provisions of paragraph 1, 2, or 3 of Article 23 (Capital) may also be
taxed in France in respect of such capital. The French tax shall be computed by allowing
a tax credit equal to the amount of tax paid in the United States on such capital. That tax credit
shall not exceed the amount of the French tax attributable to such capital.
(d) (i) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "resident of France" includes a
"société de personnes," a "groupement d’intérêt économique" (economic interest group),
or a "groupement européen d’intérêt économique" (European economic interest group}
that is constituted in France and has its place of effective management in France.
(ii) The term “amount of French tax attributable to such income" as used
in subparagraph (a) means:
(aa) where the tax on such income is computed by applying a
proportional rate, the amount of the net income concerned multiplied by
the rate which actually applies to that income;
(bb) where the tax on such income is computed by applying a
progressive scale, the amount of the net income concerned multiplied by
the rate resulting from the ratio of the French income tax actually payable
on the total net income in accordance with French law to the amount of
that total net income.
(iii) The term "amount of tax paid in the United States" as used in
subparagraph (a) means the amount of the United States income tax effectively
and definitively borne in respect of the items of income concerned, in accordance
with the provisions of the Convention, by the beneficial owner thereof who is a
resident of France. But this term shall not include the amount of tax that the
United States may levy under the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 29
(Miscellaneous Provisions).
(iv) The interpretation of subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) shall apply, by
analogy, to the terms "amount of the French tax attributable to such capital" and
"amount of tax paid in the United States," as used in subparagraph (c).
(e) (i) Where French domestic law allows companies that are residents of
France to determine their taxable profits on a consolidation basis, including the
profits or losses of subsidiaries that are residents of the United States or of
permanent establishments situated in the United States, the provisions of the
Convention shall not prevent the application of that law.
(ii) Where in accordance with its domestic law, France, in determining the
taxable profits of residents, permits the deduction of the losses of subsidiaries that
are residents of the United States or of permanent establishments situated in the
United States and includes the profits of those subsidiaries or of those permanent
establishments up to the amount of the losses so deducted, the provisions of the
Convention shall not prevent the application of that law.
(iii) Nothing in the Convention shall prevent France from applying the


```
provisions of Article 209B of its tax code (code général des impôts) or any
substantially similar provisions which may amend or replace the provisions of that
Article.
```
## ARTICLE 25

```
Non-Discrimination
```
1. Individuals who are nationals of a Contracting State and residents of the other Contracting
State shall not be subjected in that other State to any taxation or any requirement connected
therewith that is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to
which individuals who are nationals and residents of that other State in the same circumstances
are or may be subjected.
2. The taxation on a permanent establishment that an enterprise of a Contracting State has in
the other Contracting State shall not be less favorably levied in that other State than the taxation
levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not
be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State
any personal allowances, reliefs, and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status
or family responsibilities that it grants to its own residents. The provisions of this paragraph shall
not prevent the application by either Contracting State of the taxes described in paragraph 7 of
Article 10 (Dividends).
3. (a) Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9 (Associated
    Enterprises), paragraph 6 of Article 11 (Interest), or paragraph 7 of Article 12 (Royalties)
    apply, interest, royalties, and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting
    State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purposes of determining the
    taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had
    been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise
    of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purposes
    of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same
    conditions as if they had been contracted a resident of the first-mentioned State.
       (b) Nothing in this Convention shall prevent the application of Article 212 of the
    French tax code (code général des impôts) as it may be amended from time to time
    without changing the general principle thereof or of any substantially similar provisions
    which may be enacted in addition to or in substitution for that provision (including
    provisions substantially similar to those applicable in the other Contracting State), to the
    extent that such application is consistent with the principles of paragraph 1 of Article 9
    (Associated Enterprises).
4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall
not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected
therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to
which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.
5. The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2 (Taxes
Covered), apply to taxes of every kind and description imposed by a Contracting State or a


political subdivision (in the case of the United States) or local authority thereof.

## ARTICLE 26

```
Mutual Agreement Procedure
```

will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may,
irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the
competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident or national. The case must
be presented within three years of the notification of the action resulting in taxation not in
accordance with the provisions of this Convention.
2. The competent authority shall endeavor, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if
it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement
with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of
taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be
implemented notwithstanding any time limits or other procedural limitations in the domestic law
of the Contracting States.
3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavor to resolve by mutual
agreement any difficulties or doubts arising to the interpretation or application of the Convention.
In particular, they may agree:
    (a) to the same attribution of profits to a resident of a Contracting State and its
permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State;
(b) to the same allocation of income between a resident of a Contracting State and
any associated enterprise described in paragraph 1 of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises);
(c) to the same determination of the source of particular items of income;
(d) concerning the matters described in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this
paragraph with respect to past or future years; or
(e) to increase the money amounts referred to in Articles 17 (Artistes and
Sportsmen) and 21 (Students and Trainees) to reflect economic or monetary
developments.
They may also agree to eliminate double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.
4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other
directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. When
it seems advisable for the purpose of reaching agreement, the competent authorities or their
representatives may meet together for an oral exchange of opinions.
5. If an agreement cannot be reached by the competent authorities pursuant to the previous
paragraphs of this Article, the case may, if both competent authorities and the taxpayer agree, be
submitted for arbitration, provided that the taxpayer agrees in writing to be bound by the decision
of the arbitration board. The competent authorities may release to the arbitration board such
information as is necessary for carrying out the arbitration procedure. The decision of the
arbitration board shall be binding on the taxpayer and on both States with respect to that case.
The procedures, including the composition of the board, shall be established between the
Contracting States by notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels afier consultation
between the competent authorities. The provisions of this paragraph shall not have effect until

pertinent for carrying out the provisions of this Convention and of the domestic laws of the
Contracting States concerning taxes covered by this Convention insofar as the taxation
thereunder is not contrary to this Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by
Article 1 (Personal Scope). Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as
secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall
be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved
in the assessment, collection, or administration of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of
or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by this Convention. Such persons
or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the
information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.

Contracting State the obligation:

administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;
(b) to supply particulars that are not obtainable under the laws or in the normal
course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;
(c) to supply information that would disclose any trade, business, industrial,
commercial, or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of
which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).
3. The exchange of information shall be on request with reference to particular cases, or
spontaneous, or on a routine basis. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall
agree on the list of information which shall be furnished on a routine basis.
4. (a) If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this
Article, the other Contracting State shall obtain the information to which the request relates in the
same manner and to the same extent as if its own taxation were involved, notwithstanding the
fact that the other State may not, at that time, need such information for purposes of its own tax.
    (b) If specifically requested by the competent authority of a Contracting State, the
competent authority of the other Contracting State shall, if possible, provide information
under this Article in the form of depositions of witnesses and authenticated copies of
unedited original documents (including books, papers, statements, records, accounts, and
writings), to the same extent such depositions and documents can be obtained under the
laws and administrative practices of that other State with respect to its own taxes.
(c) A Contracting State shall allow representatives of the other Contracting State
to enter the first-mentioned State to interview taxpayers and look at and copy their books
and records, but only after obtaining the consent of those taxpayers and the competent
authority of the first-mentioned State (who may be present or represented, if desired), and
only if the two Contracting States agree, in an exchange of diplomatic notes, to allow
such inquiries on a reciprocal basis. Such inquiries shall not be considered audits for


```
purposes of French domestic law.
```
5. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2 (Taxes Covered), all taxes imposed on behalf
of a Contracting State shall be considered as taxes covered by the Convention for purposes of
this Article.

## ARTICLE 28

```
Assistance in Collection
```
1. The Contracting States undertake to lend assistance and support to each other in the
collection of the taxes to which this Convention applies (together with interest, costs, and
additions to the taxes and fines not being of a penal character) in cases where the taxes are
definitively due according to the laws of the State making the application.
2. Revenue claims of each of the Contracting States which have been finally determined will
be accepted for enforcement by the State to which application is made and collected in that State
in accordance with the laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes.
3. The application will be accompanied by such documents as are required by the laws of the
State making the application to establish that the taxes have been finally determined.
4. If the revenue claim has not been finally determined, the State to which application is made
will take such measures of conservancy (including measures with respect to transfer of property
of nonresident aliens) as are authorized by its laws for the enforcement of its own taxes.
5. The assistance provided for in this Article shall not be accorded with respect to citizens,
companies, or other entities of the Contracting State to which application is made except in cases
where the exemption from or reduction of tax or the payment of tax credits provided for in
paragraph 4 of Article 10 (Dividends) granted under the Convention to such citizens, companies,

or insurance company); or
(b) when France is the first-mentioned State, France taxes the profits of such

## DEPARTMENT OF STATE

## WASHINGTON

Excellency:

I have the honor to refer to the Income Tax Convention between the United States and
France, signed today.

During the course of discussions leading to the development of the Convention, the United
States and French delegations agreed that nothing in paragraph 5 of Article 11 (Interest) shall be
understood to prevent or limit the application by a Contracting State of its internal law, or of its
income tax treaty with a third State, with respect to interest paid by a permanent establishment


located in that Contracting State. The provisions of internal law referred to in the preceding
sentence are, in the case of the United States, those provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that
impose a tax on interest described in section 884(f)(1)(A) of such Code, and in the case of France
articles 119 bis and 125 A of the code général des impôts.

The United States and French delegations further agreed that the term "business property," as
used in paragraph 3 of Article 13 (Capital Gains) and paragraph 3 of Article 23 (Capital), has a
narrower meaning in some cases than does the term "assets," as used in paragraph 2 of Article 13
and paragraph 1 of Article 23, not withstanding that the single French term “actif” is used
throughout.

If this is in accord with your understanding, I would appreciate a confirmation from you to
this effect. If so, this understanding and your reply agreeing to its terms shall constitute an
integral part of the Convention.

Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

## LE MINISTRE

Madame l'Ambassadeur,

J'ai l'honneur d'accuser réception de votre lettre de ce jour dont le texte est le suivant:

“Monsieur le Ministre,

J'ai l'honneur de me référer à Convention fiscale, signée ce jour, entre la France et les Etats-
Unis.

Au cours des discussions qui ont abouti à la mise au point de cette Convention, les
délégations de la France et des Etats-Unis sont convenues que rien dans le paragraphe 5 de son
article 11 (Intérêts) ne peut être interprété comme empêchant ou limitant l'application par un Etat
contractant de sa législation interne ou de sa convention fiscale avec un Etat tiers, en ce qui
concerne les intérêts payés par un établissement stable situé dans cet Etat contractant à un
résident d'un Etat tiers.

Les dispositions de la législation interne auxquelles se réfère la phrase précédente sont, dans
le cas des Etats-Unis, les dispositions de l'‘Internal Revenue Code’ relatives à l'imposition des
intérêts définie à la section 884 (f)(1)(A) de ce code, et, dans le cas de la France, les articles 119
bis et 125 A du code général des impôts.


Les délégations des Etats-Unis et de la France sont convenues en outre que l'expression
‘business property’ employée au paragraphe 3 de l'article 13 (Gains en capital) et au paragraphe
3 de l'article 23 (Fortune) peut avoir un sens plus étroit que le terme ‘assets’ employé au
paragraphe 2 de l'article 13 et au paragraphe 1 de l'article 23, bien que le terme français ‘actif’
soit utilisé dans tous les cas.

Je vous serais obligé de me confirmer que ce qui précède recueille votre agrément. Dans
l'affirmative, cette lettre et votre réponse constitueront l'accord de nos deux Gouvernements sur
ce point, accord qui fera partie intégrante de la Convention."

J'ai l'honneur de vous confirmer l'accord de mon Gouvernement sur ce qui précède.

## LE MINISTRE

Madame l'Ambassadeur,

Me référent à la Convention fiscale, signée ce jour, entre la France et les Etats-Unis, je
souhaite, d'ordre de mon Gouvernement, vous proposer une position commune sur les deux
points suivants.

En ce qui concerne le iv) du b) du paragraphe 2 de l’article 4 (Résident), dans la mesure où
les associés ou membres d’une société de personnes, d’un groupement d’intérêt économique ou
d’un groupement européen d’intérêt économique constitué en France, qui a son siège de direction
effective en France et qui n’y est pas soumis à l’impôt sur les sociétés, sont des résidents d’un
Etat tiers, l’assujettissement à l’impôt des Etats-Unis dans le cas de cette société de personnes ou
de ce groupement est déterminé conformément à la convention fiscale en matière d’impôts sur le
revenu, s’il en existe une, entre les Etats-Unis et cet Etat tiers, étant précisé que la société de
personnes ou le groupement est traité comme un “partnership” aux fins de l’impôt des Etats-Unis
pour l’octroi des avantages de cette convention avec l’Etat tiers.

En ce qui concerne l'application de l'article 8 (Navigation maritime et aérienne), nonobstant
l'article 2 selon lequel la Convention ne s'applique qu'aux impôts nationaux des deux Etats, la
France accepte que les entreprises des Etats-Unis qui exploitent des navires ou des aéronef en
trafic international soient dégrevées d'office de la taxe professionnelle due en France à raison de
cette exploitation, à condition que les entreprises de France qui exploitent des navires ou des
aéronefs en trafic international ne soient pas soumises aux Etats-Unis, à raison de cette
exploitation, aux impôts des Etats membres sur le revenu.
Je vous serais obligé de me confirmer que ce qui précède recueille l'agrément de votre
Gouvernement. Dans l'affirmative, la présente lettre et votre réponse constitueront l'accord de nos
deux Gouvernements sur ces points, accord qui fera partie intégrante de la Convention.

## DEPARTMENT OF STATE

## WASHINGTON

Excellency:

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your Note of today’s date which reads as follows:

"In connection with the Income Tax Convention between France and the United States,
signed today, I should like, on behalf of my Government, to propose to you a common position
with respect to the two following points.

With respect to the provisions of subparagraph 2 (b) (iv) of Article 4 (Resident), to the extent
that the members of a "société de personnes," a "groupement d'intérêt économique" (economic
interest group) or a "groupement européen d'intérêt économique" (European economic interest
group) that is constituted in France and has its place of effective management in France and that
is not subject to company tax therein are residents of a third State, the U.S. income tax liability in
the case of such "société de personnes" or group shall be determined under the U.S. Income Tax
Convention, if any, with that third State, it being understood that such "société de personnes" or
group shall be treated as a partnership for the purposes of U.S. tax benefits under that
Convention.

With respect to the application of Article 8 (Shipping and Air Transport), notwithstanding
Article 2, under which the Convention applies only to taxes imposed by the national
governments, France agrees that enterprises of the United States that operate ships or aircraft in
international traffic shall be automatically relieved from the "taxe professionnelle" in France in
respect of such operations, provided that enterprises of. France that operate ships or aircraft in
international traffic are not subject to state income taxes in the United States in respect of such
operations.

If this is in accord with your understanding, I would appreciate a confirmation from you to
this effect. If so, this understanding and your reply agreeing to its terms shall constitute an
integral part of the Convention."

I have the honor to confirm the agreement of my Government on the preceding points.

Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.
