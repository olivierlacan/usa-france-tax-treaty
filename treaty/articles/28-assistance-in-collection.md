# Article 28
## Assistance in Collection

1. The Contracting States undertake to lend assistance and support to each other in the
collection of the taxes to which this Convention applies (together with interest, costs, and
additions to the taxes and fines not being of a penal character) in cases where the taxes are
definitively due according to the laws of the State making the application.

2. Revenue claims of each of the Contracting States which have been finally determined will
be accepted for enforcement by the State to which application is made and collected in that State
in accordance with the laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes.

3. The application will be accompanied by such documents as are required by the laws of the
State making the application to establish that the taxes have been finally determined.

4. If the revenue claim has not been finally determined, the State to which application is made
will take such measures of conservancy (including measures with respect to transfer of property
of nonresident aliens) as are authorized by its laws for the enforcement of its own taxes.

5. The assistance provided for in this Article shall not be accorded with respect to citizens,
companies, or other entities of the Contracting State to which application is made except in cases
where the exemption from or reduction of tax or the payment of tax credits provided for in
paragraph 4 of Article 10 (Dividends) granted under the Convention to such citizens, companies,
or other entities has, according to mutual agreement between the competent authorities of the
Contracting States, been enjoyed by persons not entitled to such benefits.
