# Article 17
## Artistes and Sportsmen

1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 14 (Independent Personal Services) and 15
(Dependent Personal Services), income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an
entertainer, such as a theater, motion picture, radio, or television artiste or a musician, or as a
sportsman, from his personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be
taxed in that other State. However, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply where the
amount of the gross receipts derived by such entertainer or sportsman from such activities,
including expenses reimbursed to him or borne on his behalf, does not exceed 10,000 United
States dollars or its equivalent in French francs for the taxable period concerned.

2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or sportsman in
his capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsman but to another person, whether or
not a resident of a Contracting State, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles
7 (Business Profits), 14 (Independent Personal Services), and 15 (Dependent Personal Services),
be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsman are
exercised. However, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply where it is established that
neither the entertainer or sportsman nor persons related to him derive from that other person any
income, directly or indirectly, in respect of such activities that in the aggregate exceeds the
amount specified in paragraph 1 for the taxable period concerned.

3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to income derived by a resident of a
Contracting State as an entertainer or a sportsman from his personal activities as such exercised
in the other Contracting State if the visit to that other State is principally supported, directly or
indirectly, by public funds of the first-mentioned State or a political subdivision (in the case of
the United States) or local authority thereof. In such case the income shall be taxable only in the
first-mentioned State.
