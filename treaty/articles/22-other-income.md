# Article 22
## Other Income

1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the
foregoing Articles of this convention shall be taxable only in that State.

2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from real
property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6 (Income from Real Property), if the recipient of
such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting
State through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State
independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in
respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment
or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) or Article 14
(Independent Personal Services), as the case may be, shall apply.
