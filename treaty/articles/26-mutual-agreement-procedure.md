# Article 26
## Mutual Agreement Procedure

1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or
will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may,
irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the
competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident or national. The case must
be presented within three years of the notification of the action resulting in taxation not in
accordance with the provisions of this Convention.

2. The competent authority shall endeavor, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if
it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement
with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of
taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be
implemented notwithstanding any time limits or other procedural limitations in the domestic law
of the Contracting States.

3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavor to resolve by mutual
agreement any difficulties or doubts arising to the interpretation or application of the Convention.
In particular, they may agree:
  (a) to the same attribution of profits to a resident of a Contracting State and its
  permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State;
  (b) to the same allocation of income between a resident of a Contracting State and
  any associated enterprise described in paragraph 1 of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises);
  (c) to the same determination of the source of particular items of income;
  (d) concerning the matters described in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this
  paragraph with respect to past or future years; or
  (e) to increase the money amounts referred to in Articles 17 (Artistes and
  Sportsmen) and 21 (Students and Trainees) to reflect economic or monetary
  developments. They may also agree to eliminate double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.

4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other
directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. When
it seems advisable for the purpose of reaching agreement, the competent authorities or their
representatives may meet together for an oral exchange of opinions.

5. If an agreement cannot be reached by the competent authorities pursuant to the previous
paragraphs of this Article, the case may, if both competent authorities and the taxpayer agree, be
submitted for arbitration, provided that the taxpayer agrees in writing to be bound by the decision
of the arbitration board. The competent authorities may release to the arbitration board such
information as is necessary for carrying out the arbitration procedure. The decision of the
arbitration board shall be binding on the taxpayer and on both States with respect to that case.
The procedures, including the composition of the board, shall be established between the
Contracting States by notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels afier consultation
between the competent authorities. The provisions of this paragraph shall not have effect until
the date specified in the exchange of diplomatic notes.
