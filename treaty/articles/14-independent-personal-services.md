# Article 14
## Independent Personal Services

1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or
other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that State unless that resident
performs activities in the other Contracting State and has a fixed base regularly available to him
in that other State for the purpose of performing his activities. In such a case, the income may be
taxed in the other State, but only so much of it as is attributable to that fixed base, and according
to the principles contained in Article 7 (Business Profits).

2. Any income attributable to a fixed base during its existence, according to the provisions of
paragraph 1, may be taxed in the Contracting State in which such fixed base is situated, even if
the payments are deferred until such fixed base has ceased to exist.

3. The term "professional services" includes especially independent scientific, literary,
artistic, educational, or teaching activities as well as the independent activities of physicians,
lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists, and accountants.

4. The provisions of paragraph 4 of Article 7 (Business Profits) shall apply by analogy. In no
event, however, shall those provisions or the provisions of Article 4 (Resident) result in France
exempting under Article 24 (Relief from Double Taxation) more than 50 percent of the earned
income from partnership accruing to a resident of France. The amount of such a partnerâ€™s income
which is not exempt under Article 24 (Relief from Double Taxation) solely by reason of the
preceding sentence shall reduce the amount of partnership earned income from sources within
France on which France can tax partners who are not residents of France.
