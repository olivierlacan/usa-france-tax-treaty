1. The taxes which are the subject of this Convention are:
  (a) in the case of the United States:

    these taxes;
  (b) in the case of France, all taxes imposed on behalf of the State, irrespective of
  the manner in which they are levied, on total income, on total capital, or on elements of
  income or of capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of movable or
  immovable property, as well as taxes on capital appreciation, in particular:
    (i) the income tax (1’ impôt sur le revenu);
    (ii) the company tax (l'impôt sur les sociétés):
    (iii) the tax on salaries (la taxe sur les salaires) governed by the provisions
    of the Convention applicable, as the case may be, to business profits or to income
    from independent personal services; and
    (iv) the wealth tax (l'impôt de solidarité sur la fortune) (hereinafter referred to as "French tax").

2. The Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are
imposed after the date of signature of the Convention in addition to, or in place of, the existing
taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any
significant changes which have been made in their respective taxation laws and of any official
published material concerning the application of the Convention, including explanations,
regulations, rulings, or judicial decisions.
