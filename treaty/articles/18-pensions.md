# Article 18
## Pensions

1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 19 (Public Remuneration):
  (a) except as provided in subparagraph (b), pensions and other similar
  remuneration, including distributions from pension and other retirement arrangements,
  derived and beneficially owned by a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of
  past employment, whether paid periodically or in a lump sum, shall be taxable only in
  that State:
  (b) pensions and other payments made under the social security legislation of a
  Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the
  first-mentioned State. Pensions and other payments made under the social security
  legislation of France to a resident of France who is a citizen of the United States shall be
  taxable only in France. The term "social security legislation" includes the Railroad
  Retirement Act in the case of the United States and the French social security regimes
  which are of a mandatory character.

2.  (a) In determining the taxable income of an individual who renders personal
    services and who is a resident of a Contracting State but not a national of that State,
    contributions paid by, or on behalf of, such individual to a pension or other retirement
    arrangement that is established and maintained and recognized for tax purposes in the
    other Contracting State shall be treated in the same way for tax purposes in the first-
    mentioned State as a contribution paid to a pension or other retirement arrangement that
    is established and maintained and recognized for tax purposes in that first-mentioned
    State, provided that the competent authority of the first-mentioned State agrees that the
    pension or other retirement arrangement generally corresponds to a pension or other
    retirement arrangement recognized for tax purposes by that State.
    (b) For the purposes of subparagraph (a):
      (i) where the competent authority of France agrees that a United States
      pension or other retirement arrangement generally corresponds to a mandatory
      French pension arrangement (without regard to the mandatory nature of such
      arrangement), it is understood that contributions to the United States pension or
      other retirement arrangement shall be treated in France in the same way for tax
      purposes as contributions to the French mandatory pension arrangement; and
      (ii) where the competent authority of the United States agrees that a
      mandatory French pension or other retirement arrangement generally corresponds
      to a United States pension or other retirement arrangement (without regard to the
      mandatory nature of such arrangement), it is understood that contributions to the
      French pension or other retirement arrangement shall be treated in the United
      States in the same way for tax purposes as contributions to the United States
      pension or other retirement arrangement; and
      (iii) a pension or other retirement arrangement is recognized for tax
      purposes in a State if the contributions to the arrangement would qualify for tax
      relief in that State.
    (c) Payments received by a beneficiary in respect of an arrangement referred to in
    subparagraph (a) that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph shall be included in
    income for tax purposes of the Contracting State of which the beneficiary is a resident,
    subject to the provisions of Article 24 (Relief from Double Taxation), when and to the
    extent that such payments are considered gross income by the other Contracting State.
