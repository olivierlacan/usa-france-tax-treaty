# Article 25
## Non-Discrimination

1. Individuals who are nationals of a Contracting State and residents of the other Contracting
State shall not be subjected in that other State to any taxation or any requirement connected
therewith that is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to
which individuals who are nationals and residents of that other State in the same circumstances
are or may be subjected.

2. The taxation on a permanent establishment that an enterprise of a Contracting State has in
the other Contracting State shall not be less favorably levied in that other State than the taxation
levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not
be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State
any personal allowances, reliefs, and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status
or family responsibilities that it grants to its own residents. The provisions of this paragraph shall
not prevent the application by either Contracting State of the taxes described in paragraph 7 of
Article 10 (Dividends).

3.  (a) Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9 (Associated
    Enterprises), paragraph 6 of Article 11 (Interest), or paragraph 7 of Article 12 (Royalties)
    apply, interest, royalties, and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting
    State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purposes of determining the
    taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had
    been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise
    of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purposes
    of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same
    conditions as if they had been contracted a resident of the first-mentioned State.
    (b) Nothing in this Convention shall prevent the application of Article 212 of the
    French tax code (code général des impôts) as it may be amended from time to time
    without changing the general principle thereof or of any substantially similar provisions
    which may be enacted in addition to or in substitution for that provision (including
    provisions substantially similar to those applicable in the other Contracting State), to the
    extent that such application is consistent with the principles of paragraph 1 of Article 9
    (Associated Enterprises).

4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall
not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected
therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to
which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.

5. The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2 (Taxes
Covered), apply to taxes of every kind and description imposed by a Contracting State or a
political subdivision (in the case of the United States) or local authority thereof.
