  exchanges, persons referred to in subparagraph (b), companies of which
  more than 50 percent of the aggregate vote and value of their shares is
  owned by persons referred to in subparagraph (b), one or more member

  subdivisions, or authorities, and companies of which more than 50 percent
  of the aggregate vote and value of their shares is owned by such member
  states, subdivisions, authorities, or agencies or instrumentalities;
  (d) a person, if 50 percent or more of the beneficial interest in such person (or, in
  the case of a company, 50 percent or more of the vote and value of the company’s shares)
  is not owned, directly or indirectly, by persons that are not qualified persons, and:
  (i) less than 50 percent of the gross income of such person is used, directly
  or indirectly, to make deductible payments to persons that are not qualified
  persons; or
  (ii) less than 70 percent of such gross income is used, directly or indirectly,
  to make deductible payments to persons that are not qualified persons and less
  then 30 percent of such gross income is used, directly or indirectly, to make
  deductible payments to persons that are neither qualified persons nor residents of
  member states of the European Union;
  (e) a pension trust or an organization referred to in subparagraph (b) (ii) of
  paragraph 2 of Article 4 (Resident), provided that more than half of its beneficiaries,
  members, or participants, if any, are qualified persons; or
  (f) an investment entity referred to in subparagraph (b) (iii) of paragraph 2 of
  Article 4 (Residence) provided that more than half of the shares, rights, or interests in
  such entity is owned by qualified parsons.

2.  (a) A resident of a Contracting State shall also be entitled to the benefits of the
    Convention with respect to income derived from the other Contracting State if:
      (i) such resident is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business in
      the first-mentioned State (other than the business of making or managing
      investments, unless the activities are banking or insurance activities carried on by
      a bank or insurance company);
      (ii) the income is connected with or incidental to the trade or business in
      the first-mentioned State; and
      (iii) the trade or business is substantial in relation to the activity in the
      other State that generated the income.
    (b) For purposes of subparagraph (a), whether the trade or business of the resident
    in the first-mentioned State is substantial in relation to the activity in the other State will
    be determined based on all of the facts and circumstances. In any case, however, the trade
    or business will be deemed substantial if, for the first preceding taxable period or for the
    average of the three preceding taxable periods, each of the following ratios equals at least
    7.5 percent and the average of the ratios exceeds 10 percent:
      (i) the ratio of the value of assets used or held for use in the conduct of the
      trade or business of the resident in the first-mentioned State to the value of assets
      used or held for use in the conduct of the activity in the other State;
      (ii) the ratio of the gross income derived from the conduct of the trade or
      business of the resident in the first-mentioned State to the gross income derived
      from the conduct of the activity in the other States;
      (iii) the ratio of the payroll expense of the trade or business of the resident
      in the first-mentioned State for services performed in that State to the payroll
      expense of the activity in the other State for services performed in that other State.
      In determining the above ratios, assets, income, and payroll expense shall be taken into account
      only to the extent of the resident’s direct or indirect ownership interest in the activity in the other
      State. If neither the resident nor any of its associated enterprises has an ownership interest in the
      activity in the other State, the resident’s trade or business in the first-mentioned State shall be
      considered substantial in relation to such activity.

3. A resident of a Contracting State shall also be entitled to the benefits of this Convention if
that resident functions as a headquarter company for a multinational corporate group.

4. A company resident in a Contracting State shall also be entitled to the benefits of the
Convention in respect of income referred to in Articles 10 (Dividends), 11 (Interest), or 12
(Royalties) if:
  (a) more than 30 percent of the aggregate vote and value of all of its shares is
  owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified persons resident in that State;
  (b) more than 70 percent of all such shares is owned, directly or indirectly, by any
  combination of one or more qualified persons and persons that are residents of member
  states of the European Union; and
  (c) such company meets the base reduction test described in subparagraphs (d) (i)
  and (ii) of paragraph 1.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 through 4, where an enterprise of a
Contracting State that is exempt from tax in that State on the profits of its permanent
establishments which are not situated in that State derives income from the other Contracting
State, and that income is attributable to a permanent establishment which that enterprise has in a
third jurisdiction, the tax benefits that would otherwise apply under the other provisions of the
Convention will not apply to any item of income on which the combined tax in the first-
mentioned State and in the third jurisdiction is less than 60 percent of the tax that would be
imposed in the first-mentioned State if the income were earned in that State by the enterprise and
were not attributable to the permanent establishment in the third jurisdiction. Any dividends,
interest, or royalties to which the provisions of this paragraph apply shall be subject to tax in the
other State at a rate not exceeding 15 percent of the gross amount thereof. Any other income to
which the provisions of this paragraph apply shall be subject to tax under the provisions of the
domestic law of the other Contracting State, notwithstanding any other provision of the
Convention. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if:
  (a) the income derived from the other Contracting State is in connection with or
  incidental to the active conduct of a trade or business carried on by the permanent
  establishment in the third jurisdiction (other than the business of making or managing
  investments unless these activities are banking or insurance activities carried on by a bank
  or insurance company); or
  (b) when France is the first-mentioned State, France taxes the profits of such
  permanent establishment according to the provisions of its domestic law referred to in
  subparagraph (e) (iii) of paragraph 2 of Article 24 (Relief from Double Taxation) or the
  United States taxes such profits according to the provisions of subpart F of part II of sub-
  chapter N of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, as it may be amended
  from time to time without changing the general principle thereof.

  (a) The reference in subparagraphs (c) (ii) and (c) (iii) of paragraph 1 to shares
  that are owned "directly or indirectly" shall mean that all companies in the chain of
  ownership must be residents of a Contracting State or of a member state of the European
  Union, as defined in subparagraph (d) of paragraph 6.
  (b) The term "gross income," as used in subparagraph (d) of paragraph 1, means

  income for the four taxable periods preceding the current taxable period.
  (c) The term "deductible payments" as used in subparagraph (d) of paragraph 1
  includes payments for interest or royalties, but does not include payments at arm’s length
  for the purchase or use of or the right to use tangible property in the ordinary course of
  business or remuneration at arm’s length for services performed in the Contracting State
  in which the person making such payments is a resident. Types of payments may be
  added to, or eliminated from, the exceptions mentioned in the preceding definition of
  "deductible payments" by mutual agreement of the competent authorities.
  (d) The term "resident of a member state of the European Union," as used in
  paragraph 1, means a person that would be entitled to the benefits of a comprehensive
  income tax convention in force between any member state of the European Union and the
  Contracting State from which the benefits of this Convention are claimed, provided that if
  such convention does not contain a comprehensive Limitation on Benefits article
  (including provisions similar to those of subparagraphs (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 and
  paragraph 2 of this Article), the person would be entitled to the benefits of this
  Convention under the principles of paragraph 1 if such person were a resident of one of
  the Contracting States under Article 4 (Resident) of this Convention.
  (e) The term "recognized securities exchange" as used in paragraph 1 means:

  that is so engaged, or is so engaged through one or more associated enterprises (wherever
  resident);
  (h) the term "headquarter company" as used in paragraph 3 means a person
  fulfilling the following conditions:
    (i) it provides in the Contracting State of which it is a resident a substantial
    portion of the overall supervision and administration of a multinational corporate
    group, which may include, but cannot be principally, group financing;
    (ii) the corporate group consists of companies that are resident in, and
    engaged in an active business in, at least five countries, and the business activities
    carried on in each of the five countries (or five groupings of countries) generate at
    least 10 percent of the gross income of the group;

    (ii).
    If the gross income requirements of subparagraph (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this paragraph are not
    fulfilled, they will be deemed to be fulfilled if the required ratios are met when calculated on the
    basis of the average gross income of the headquarters company and the average gross income of
    the group for the preceding four taxable periods.

7. A resident of a Contracting State that is not entitled to the benefits of the Convention under
the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this Article shall, nevertheless, be granted the
benefits of the Convention if the competent authority of the other Contracting State determines,
upon such person’s request,
  (a) that the establishment, acquisition, or maintenance of such person and the
  conduct of its operations did not have as one of its principal purposes the obtaining of
  benefits under the Convention, or
  (b) that it would not be appropriate, having regard to the purpose of this Article, to
  deny the benefits of the Convention to such person.
  The competent authority of the other Contracting State shall consult with the competent authority
  of the first-mentioned State before denying the benefits of the Convention under this paragraph.

8. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may consult together with a view to
developing a commonly agreed application of the provisions of this Article.
