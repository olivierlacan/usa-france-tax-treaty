## LETTER OF SUBMITTAL

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

Washington, September 9, 1994.
The PRESIDENT,
The White House.

THE PRESIDENT: I have the honor to submit to you, with a view to its transmission to the
Senate for advice and consent to ratification, the Convention Between the Government of the
United States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the Avoidance of
Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and
Capital, signed at Paris on August 31, 1994, together with two related exchanges of notes signed
on the same date.

The new Convention will replace the existing income tax convention between the United
States and France, which was signed in 1967 and amended by Protocols signed in 1970, 1978,
1984, and 1988, and the side letters relating thereto. The new Convention maintains many
provisions of the existing convention; but it also provides certain additional benefits, and it
updates the text to reflect current tax treaty policies.

Like all U.S. income tax conventions, this Convention provides rules specifying when
income that arises in one of the countries and is derived by residents of the other country may be
taxed by the country in which the income arises (the “source country”). Rules are provided for
each category of income, such as business profits, investment income, and personal service
income. The Convention confirms that the country of residence will avoid international double
taxation by providing relief for the tax imposed by the source country. It also provides for
administrative cooperation between the tax authorities of the two countries in applying the
Convention and the taxes covered by the Convention. The benefits of the Convention are limited
to qualified residents of the two countries.

The new Convention confirms that residents of each country include tax-exempt
organizations created for charitable and other not-for-profit purposes or for purposes of providing
pension benefits, and extends to them part of the dividend tax credit that France provides in the


Convention to other U.S. portfolio investors. It also addresses the treatment of dividends paid by
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts, bringing those provisions into
line with current U.S. treaty policy. The new Convention clarifies the scope of the exemption at
source of copyright royalties.

An important improvement in the new Convention is the modernization of the limitation on
benefits provisions, designed to ensure that the benefits of the Convention are enjoyed only by
those persons intended to derive such benefits. The compliance aspects of the Convention are
also strengthened by bringing up to date the provisions concerning associated enterprises and the
exchange of tax information.

The new Convention preserves the special French tax benefits for U.S. citizens residing in
France and for French residents who are partners of U.S. partnerships.

The exchanges of diplomatic notes accompany the Convention and state the understandings
of the two delegations with respect to the application of the Convention in specified cases.

The United States and France will notify each other when their respective constitutional and
statutory requirements for the entry into force of the Convention have been satisfied. The
Convention will enter into force on the date of receipt of the later of those notifications. The
provisions concerning taxes on dividends, interests, and royalties and the U.S. excise tax on
insurance premiums paid to foreign insurers will take effect on the first day of the second month
following the entry into force. The provisions concerning other taxes generally will take effect
for taxable years or taxable events occurring on or after January 1 of the year following the entry
into force. However, certain provisions concerning the availability of the French dividend tax
credit and the application of the copyright royalty exemption will apply for dividends and
royalties paid or credited on or after January 1, 1991. The 1967 convention and the related
exchanges of letters will cease to have effect as of the date on which the provisions of this
Convention become effective.

A technical memorandum explaining in detail the provisions of the Convention will be
prepared by the Department of Treasury and will be submitted separately to the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations.

The Department of the Treasury and the Department of State cooperated in the negotiation of
the convention. It has the full approval of both Departments.

Respectfully submitted,

```
WARREN CHRISTOPHER.

## LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL

THE WHITE HOUSE, September 19, 1994.
To the Senate of the United States:

Income and Capital, signed at Paris on August 31, 1994, together with two related exchanges of
notes. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State
with respect to the Convention.

The Convention replaces the 1967 income tax convention between the United States of
America and the French Republic and the related protocols and exchanges of notes. The new
Convention more accurately reflects current income tax treaty policies of the two countries.

I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and
related exchanges of notes and give its advice and consent to ratification.
