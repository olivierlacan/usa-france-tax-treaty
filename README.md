# Convention between the government of the United States of America and
  the government of the French Republic for the avoidance of double
  taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on
  income and capital

This is a conversion of the tax treaty PDF documents [hosted by the IRS
website][1]. As they stand, the IRS documents are extremely difficult to
parse. None of them offer a comprehensive version of the the tax treaty
that includes all ammendments made after its original signing in 1994.
This project aims to offer a much more easily understandable version of
this tax treaty for the benefit of fellow French citizen conducting
business or receiving income in the United States of America.

Git commit dates for documents have been modified to reflect the
official dates at which these documents were actually signed and
published. This is done in order to make diffing (comparison) of
incremental changes much easier.
